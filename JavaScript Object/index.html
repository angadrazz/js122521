    //Question :- How do you create an object in JavaScript?
    
    //Sure, here's an example of creating an object using object literal notation:


let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
    state: "CA",
    zip: "12345"
  },
  sayHello: function() {
    document.write( alert("Hello, my name is " + this.name));
  }
};

//In this example, we've created an object called "person" that has properties for name, age, and address (which is itself an object with properties for street, city, state, and zip) as well as a method called "sayHello" that logs a message to the console.
